# Andela---Ruby


ANDELA CLASS XII BOOTCAMP.
                                      
After my fourth attempt , I finally made bootcamp and earned a place in the Ruby class. Unfortunately, 
I could not make it to week 2 with my very little knowledge of only Javascript, Obviously some people came very prepared.
I learnt a lot nevertheless.

Back to my drawing board.
